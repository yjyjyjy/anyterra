## Working with GPU Optimized AMIs

- To get ECS Tasks to work with the GPU in GPU enabled Instances please use Amazon ECS GPU-optimized AMIs, Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html
- Please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-gpu.html
- Find AMI ID using the following aws cli commands

```bash
aws ssm get-parameters-by-path --path /aws/service/ecs/optimized-ami/amazon-linux-2/gpu/ --region us-east-1 --query 'Parameters[].Value' --output text | jq -r '. | "\(.image_name) \(.image_id)" ' | sort
```
- DISCLAIMER: the above command works on linux and needs `jq` installed. If you are not using linux, you can remove the sort part of the command and install jq to run the command.
- After the above command find the latest image.
